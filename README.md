# Chatbot Using API (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This is a simple chatbot project which is made using HTML CSS and Javascript. The chatbot is working using API. It can talk to user and give some answers base on what user is typing.

## About Project

Chatbots are use everywhere now a days. So I decide to create a simple chatbot which can talk to user like human. I used API to connect chatbot with backend logic.

No backend is made by me. It is just frontend based chatbot with use of openapi or any chatbot api.

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structure
- CSS for design and styling
- JavaScript for logic and API calling
- GEMINI API or some dummy api for backend response

## How It Works

- User type message in input box.
- On send button click, message is sended to API using fetch.
- API return reply and it shown on screen like real chatbot.
- All messages shown in chat window.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download zip.
2. Open `index.html` file in browser.
3. Type message and press send.
4. You will see chatbot reply.

## Requirements

Just a browser is enough.

## Folder Structure

- `index.html` – main page
- `style.css` – styling of chatbot
- `script.js` – contains javascript logic and api call

## Output Screenshot

*(Add your screenshot here if available)*

## Known Issues

- Sometimes API not respond due to limit or network.
- UI is basic and not mobile friendly much.
- No login or database used.

## Future Scope

- Can make login and database to store chats.
- Improve UI using bootstrap.
- Add speech to text.
